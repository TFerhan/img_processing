# img_processing

Just with simple matrix operations, we can manipulate an image in various ways like rotation, changing colors, and many other things.

## Project Description

This repository contains a Python script (Script.py) that implements several image processing functions using basic matrix operations. The goal of this project is to showcase how simple mathematical operations can be used to manipulate images.

## Features

- Image Rotation: Rotate the image clockwise or counterclockwise by a specified angle.
- Color Transformation: Apply color transformations to the image, such as grayscale, invert colors.
- Generate binary and random multicolored image.
- Adding two images horizontally and vertically.
## Usage

To use the image processing functions provided in the `Script.py`. The script uses standard Python libraries, you may need to install numpy, matplotlib.
For other informations check the Documentation.

Make sure you have placed the principal.jpg image in the same directory as the script.

## Documentation

For detailed information about the implementation, usage, and credits, please refer to the report.pdf file in this repository.
